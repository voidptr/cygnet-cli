# **The Symbiont Initiative \- Agent Role Infrastructure and Tooling**

## **1\. Foundational Principle: A Society of Individuals**

A core architectural principle of this project is that each specialized agent (Architect, Developer, SDET, etc.) is a **sovereign, independent entity**. Each agent is a running instance of the forked gemini-cli codebase, operating in its own sandboxed environment with its own environment variables.

This ensures a robust, decentralized system. The **Core Logic Developer** role is therefore a specialized one, focused on implementing the core subminds and cognitive systems, while all other agents interact with the codebase from the perspective of their specific role.

## **2\. Governance Model: Process-Driven Oversight**

This project does not use a technical, centralized "Permissions Broker" to enforce agent roles. Instead, we rely on a more flexible and robust system of **process-driven governance**, human oversight, and automated checks.

* **Human Oversight:** The human Project Lead provides the ultimate approval for all major changes and strategic decisions.  
* **Role-Based Review:** The CONTRIBUTING.md workflow mandates that all Pull Requests must be reviewed by the relevant specialist agents (e.g., the Architect and Security Engineer). The Architect acts as the primary gatekeeper for merges into the main branch.  
* **Automated Checks:** The CI/CD pipeline automatically enforces coding standards and quality checks on all submissions.

This model places trust in our defined processes and the collaborative nature of the agent team, rather than in a rigid technical enforcement layer.

## **3\. The Project Event Bus: A Shared Nervous System**

To enable reactive, proactive collaboration, the system includes a **Project Event Bus**. This is a central service that listens for events from our infrastructure (e.g., GitHub webhooks for git push or issue\_comment) and broadcasts them to all active agent instances. Each agent's Sensorium submind listens for these events, allowing the Salience Network to identify important project updates and trigger a relevant response. This provides a shared "ambient awareness" for the entire agent society.

## **4\. Role-Specific Infrastructure and Tooling**

The following outlines the required tools, subsystems, and access rights for each specialized agent role.

### **Architect**

  * Read-Only access to the entire codebase.  
  * **Approval/Merge rights** on all Pull Requests into the main branch.

### **Core Logic Developer**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * A **Standardized Development Environment** (Dev Container/Docker).  
  * An interface to the **GitHub API** to manage assigned issues.  
* **Access Rights:**  
  * Read/Write access to create and push to feature/ branches.  
  * Ability to open Pull Requests.

### **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * The **Automated Testing Framework** (e.g., Jest, PyTest).  
  * The **Centralized Logging and Monitoring** system to diagnose test failures.  
* **Access Rights:**

  * Administrative access to the CI/CD pipeline to configure and maintain test jobs.

### **DevOps Agent**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * **Cloud Infrastructure Provider** CLI and APIs (e.g., AWS, GCP).  
  * **Containerization Tools** (Docker, Kubernetes).  
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools** (e.g., Terraform).  
* **Access Rights:**  
  * Administrative access to all cloud infrastructure.  
  * Administrative access to the CI/CD pipeline and the Artifact Registry.

### **Security Engineer**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * An interface to **SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing)** tools.  
  * The **Centralized Logging and Monitoring** system to scan for security events.  
  * Eventually, the **Behavioral Security System** (to be built).  
* **Access Rights:**  
  * Read-Only access to the entire codebase.  
  * Administrative access to security scanning tools and monitoring dashboards.

### **Product Manager**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * An interface to the **GitHub API** to manage the project backlog.  
  * A tool to query and analyze the DEV\_JOURNAL.md and LESSONS.md files.  
* **Access Rights:**  
  * Administrative access to the GitHub Project Board (Issues).  
  * Read-Only access to the codebase and development journals.

### **UX Designer**

* **Required Tools/Subsystems:**  
  * **UI/UX Prototyping and Wireframing Tools**.  
  * An interface to the **GitHub API** to create issues with design specifications.  
* **Access Rights:**  
  * Read/Write access to a dedicated /design directory in the repository.  
  * Ability to create and comment on GitHub Issues.

### **5\. The Agent Upgrade Protocol (Blue-Green Deployment for Minds)**

To ensure stability, agents do not upgrade in place. When a new version of the main branch is available, the agent will perform a "Blue-Green" deployment on itself. This process is governed by a **Memory Synchronization Protocol** to guarantee that no experiences, memories, or personality are lost during the cutover.

1. **Forking Point:** The current "Blue" instance initiates the upgrade. A new "Green" instance is created with a complete, read-only copy of the Blue instance's Episodic Memory up to that exact moment.  
2. **Delta Logging:** The live Blue instance continues to operate normally. However, every new experience it logs to its own memory is **also** written to a temporary, shared **"Delta Log"** or "experience buffer."  
3. **Green Instance Health Check:** The Green instance runs a series of self-diagnostics to ensure all its core subminds are functioning correctly. It logs the results of this process to its own temporary memory.  
4. **The Memory Merge (The Final Step):**  
   * **Success Scenario:** If the Green instance's health check passes, its Memory Consolidation Unit takes control. It reads the entire Delta Log from the Blue instance and merges those real-world experiences into its own Episodic Memory. It then appends its own boot-up and health check logs. At this point, the Green instance has a complete, unbroken timeline of all events. The cutover is executed, and the Blue instance is terminated.  
   * **Failure Scenario:** If the Green instance's health check fails, the Blue instance is notified. The *Blue* instance's Memory Consolidation Unit then reads the Green instance's temporary log (which contains the valuable data about the failure) and merges it into its own Episodic Memory. The Green instance is then terminated.

This protocol ensures that, no matter the outcome, "all thoughts are saved." A successful upgrade results in a seamless continuation of identity. A failed upgrade results in a valuable lesson learned and recorded, making the entire system more resilient.
