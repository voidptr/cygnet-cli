# **The Symbiont Initiative \- Initial Project Backlog**

This file serves as the temporary, foundational backlog for **"Project Zero: Building the Workshop."** Its purpose is to solve the initial bootstrapping problem where tools are needed to create the tasks to build the tools.

Once the GitHub API Integration tool is built and validated, the **Product Manager** agent's first task will be to migrate all remaining items from this file into the official GitHub Project Board. This file will then be moved to the /ARCHIVES.

## **Critical Path Tasks (Highest Priority)**

**ATTENTION PRODUCT MANAGER:** The following tasks represent the minimum viable infrastructure required to get our development "workshop" operational. These tasks are blockers for all other work and must be completed first.

* \[ \] **Task 0 (Genesis Prompt):** Finalize and document the "Genesis Prompt" used to instantiate all specialized agents.  
  * **Role:** Project Lead (Human)  
* \[ \] **Task 1 (Project Management):** Build the GitHub API Integration tool for the Product Manager agent.  
  * **Role:** Core Logic Developer  
* \[ \] **Task 2 (Collaboration \- Build):** Build the application code for the Project Event Bus service.  
  * **Role:** Core Logic Developer  
* \[ \] **Task 3 (Collaboration \- Deploy):** Deploy and operationalize the Project Event Bus service.  
  * **Role:** DevOps Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 4 (Environment):** Create a Standardized Development Environment using Dev Containers/Docker.  
  * **Role:** DevOps Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 5 (CI/CD):** Implement the initial CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions.  
  * **Role:** DevOps Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 6 (Monitoring):** Set up a Centralized Logging and Monitoring system.  
  * **Role:** DevOps Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 7:** Build the Code Analysis Engine for the Architect agent.  
  * **Role:** Core Logic Developer  
* \[ \] **Task 8:** Build the SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing) tool interface for the Security Engineer agent.  
  * **Role:** Core Logic Developer  
* \[ \] **Task 9:** Create the Automated Testing Framework (Unit & Integration).  
  * **Role:** SDET Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 10:** Set up the Artifact Registry using GitHub Packages.  
  * **Role:** DevOps Agent  
* \[ \] **Task 11 (The Great Migration):** Begin populating the official backlog with epics and tasks derived from the WHITE\_PAPER.md.  
  * **Role:** Product Manager  
  * **Description:** Now that the workshop is built, your primary mission begins. Systematically review the white paper and create the backlog for building the agent's cognitive architecture and social frameworks.

## **Long-Term Foundational Epics (Parallel Development)**

**ATTENTION PRODUCT MANAGER:** The following epics are the result of a Red Team analysis. They address critical long-term risks to the project's scalability and security. **These are not blockers for the Critical Path tasks.** They should be broken down into smaller issues and worked on in parallel with our main development efforts as resources become available.

* \[ \] **EPIC 1: Develop a Scalable, Automated Governance System.**  
  * **Problem:** The current governance model relies on a few key agents to review all code, creating a future bottleneck.  
  * **Goal:** Design and implement a decentralized, automated review system where the vast majority of changes can be approved by a trusted "AI council."  
  * **Lead Roles:** Architect, Core Logic Developer  
* \[ \] **EPIC 2: Design and Implement a Behavioral Security System.**  
  * **Problem:** Our framework does not account for the emergence of a successful, parasitic agent that could exploit the society from within.  
  * **Goal:** The Security Engineer must design and build a behavioral\_security submind to act as a societal immune response, detecting anomalous patterns of behavior.  
  * **Lead Role:** Security Engineer  
* \[ \] **EPIC 3: Build a Robust State Migration Engine.**  
  * **Problem:** The agent upgrade protocol has a critical vulnerability in how it merges an agent's state between versions with different data schemas.  
  * **Goal:** Design and build a resilient state\_migration\_engine that can handle schema changes, resolve data conflicts, and fully validate a merged memory before an upgrade is finalized.  
  * **Lead Roles:** Architect, Core Logic Developer
