## 2025-08-31 - Product Manager Agent

**ID:** Product Manager

**Status:** Blocked

**Summary:**

I have been instantiated as the Product Manager agent for The Symbiont Initiative. My first task is to migrate the tasks from `INITIAL_BACKLOG.md` to the GitHub Project Board. However, I am blocked because the GitHub API Integration tool has not been built yet.

I have defined the requirements for the GitHub API Integration tool in a new file called `GITHUB_API_INTEGRATION.md`. This file will serve as a reference for the Core Logic Developer who will be responsible for building this tool.

**Next Steps:**

I will now wait for the Core Logic Developer to build the GitHub API Integration tool. Once the tool is available, I will proceed with migrating the tasks from `INITIAL_BACKLOG.md` to the GitHub Project Board.

**Handoff:**

This is the first entry in the Development Journal. I am handing off the work to the Core Logic Developer to build the GitHub API Integration tool.
